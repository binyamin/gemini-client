# Gemium
A pretty (imho) desktop app for browsing the gemini universe.

> Note: Gemium is **pre-alpha**. Essentially, the app is not very user-friendly or intuitive. See [./roadmap](./roadmap) for a rough timeline.

## About
### Goals
* Browsing - View remote and local gemini pages
* User control - Allow a custom user-agent stylesheet
* Design - Interface should be simple, organized, and visually pleasing
